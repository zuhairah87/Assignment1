My dataset is from (https://github.com/chathuHet/RiskPredictionSystem_Dengue)
The dataset is use from Risk prediction system for dengue transmission based on high resolution weather data in Taiwan. The data is to demonstrate a risk prediction system using high resolution weather data can provide valuable insight to the distribution of risk over a geographical region. it also shows that a two-stage approach is beneficial in predicting risk in non-homogeneous regions, where the risk is localised. (Hettiarachchige C & et al., 2018)


The first stage is to predict the presence/absence of aeges aegypti larvae (mosquito). This project is to determine the best predictive modelling by using machine learning technique to predict this
